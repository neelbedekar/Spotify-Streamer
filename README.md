# Spotify-Streamer
The Spotify Streamer is an Android app that allows users to search for artists and songs. This uses a wrapper to the Spotify Android Api, querying the Api based on the user's search for an artist. Once a list of artists is displayed, the user selects one, and a list of the top 10 tracks of that artist is displayed. The user can click on each track to play a 30 second preview of each song (the Api only allowed for a preview as opposed to the entire song). Once the song is selected, a player window allows the user to control the playback by pausing, playing, scrubbing, and more.
This app is optimized for both phones and tablets; however, the dimensions are best suited for xxhdpi phones and tablets, such as
the Nexus 5, on which this was tested. The code will work on any resolution of phone or tablet, but the dimensions will look odd,
so I'd recommend running the program using an emulator of resolution xxhdpi if your phone or tablet is of a different resolution.
In the off chance that the initial gradle build fails, it'll be because of a different version of Android Studio or build/compile tools being used. This is very unlikely, but in case a very old version is used, it'll be necessary to change a few lines in the app/build.gradle file, namely the compileSdkVersion and buildToolsVersion, and possibly the minSdkVersion or targetSdkVersion.
